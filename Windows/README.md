## Windows version of MWC

## Software
There will be some steps for installing all the software on your computer. For now i don't know an alternative to Linux terminal that can install software like that. 
1. Clean all the bloadware that Windows 10 has. Running Remove-windows10-bloat.bat as Administrator.
2. The first software we are going to use is [Ninite](https://ninite.com). They are fremium software so i think it will be great for here.

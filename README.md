# MWC
My workstation configuration or (MWC) is all my workstation setup, guides and etc in one place. For all to use and mainly for me. (I loose most of them regularly.)
# What is the diffirence between MWC and (someone else setup)?
I work in a mix of environments or in other words in home i have Windows and Linux and at work i have to use Mac OS. So that is why this project is started. To help others who were like me in the beggining and if there are better alternatives to my suggestions it will be a WIN WIN senario.
